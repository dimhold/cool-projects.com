What is Fon? 

Fon is your Global WiFi Network. It is built by people just like you. Fon members share a bit of their home WiFi, and in turn get free access at millions of other Fon hotspots worldwide.

Joining is easy. All you have to do is buy a Fon WiFi router and plug it into your broadband connection. No monthly fees! Or, if you live in a country where Fon has a telco partner, just sign up with them to become a member.
